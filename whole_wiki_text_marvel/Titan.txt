Titan is a size-shifting warrior serving in the Royal Elite of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard, a multi-ethnic group of super-powered alien beings who act as enforcers of the laws of the Shi'ar Empire. Titan was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutants known as the X-Men who sought to rescue the Princess Lilandra from her insane brother emperor D'Ken. Following the orders of their emperor, the Guard clashed with the X-Men on a nameless Shi'ar Empire planet, and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor.Some time later, when Deathbird was empress, Titan joined the other Imperial Guard members in battle against Excalibur and the Starjammers. Titan fought Captain Britain. Later, on Deathbird's behalf, Titan assisted the other Imperial Guardsmen in battle against the X-Men and Starjammers, but was defeated by them.Later after Lilandra became leader of the Shi'ar Empire, Titan was amongst a small group of Imperial Guard that defended their Empress Lilandra against the Kree super-team known as Starforce, during the war between the Shi'ar and Kree Empires.  Titan battled the Supremor android. Titan also joined in the Imperial Guard's battle with the Avengers on the Shi'ar throne world of Chandilar during the Kree-Shi'ar War, but was defeated by the Scarlet Witch.In the battle against Vulcan, Titan seemed to have been killed, but was actually only seriously wounded and later reappeared.
