Velocidad (Gabriel Cohuelo) is a mutant in the Marvel Universe. The first character, created by Matt Fraction and Kieron Gillen, first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #527 in 2010.
Gabriel is a 16-year-old mutant from Mexico City. He is unable to control his mutant powers until assisted by Hope Summers. Gabriel follows Hope on her mission to find other young mutants, and they ally with Oya and Primal. He and his friends relocate to Utopia, where they are trained by more experienced X-Men. Gabriel and Hope begin a romantic relationship, but it ends when Hope discovers him kissing Pixie. Because Velocidad's powers work by accelerating him through time, the use of his powers causes rapid aging. A four-hour mission can last several days from his perspective, and he is capable of burning through several days of his life in a matter of minutes.


=== Other versions of Velocidad ===
Gabriel briefly appears during Age of X.
