== Fictional team biography ==


=== Thanos' version ===
The Black Order is a group of ruthless aliens that serve Thanos. They help Thanos raze worlds from which they demand tribute. When Corvus Glaive sent one of their Outriders to find a new world to raze, the Outrider targeted Earth.The Black Order arrive on Earth in search of the Infinity Gems, which are under the control of the Illuminati. Each member of the Order targets a member of the Illuminati with varying degrees of success. During their search for the gems, Ebony Maw finds Thanos' son, Thane, whom Thanos wishes to kill.During a battle with the Avengers, Black Dwarf and Supergiant are killed, Ebony Maw betrays Thanos and frees Thane. Thane traps Thanos, Corvus Glaive, and Proxima Midnight in an amber construct which leaves them in a state of "living death."While imprisoned in the Triskelion, Thanos was approached by a mysterious cloaked figure who offered him support in obtaining the Mjolnir of Earth-1610. Thanos accepted the deal. In order to make sure it was a success, Thanos formed a second incarnation of the Black Order with Proxima Midnight and Black Swan of Earth-1365. He dispatched them to the Collector's ship in order to obtain the Mjolnir of Earth-1610. There, the trio battled Thor and Beta Ray Bill and failed in retrieving the hammer. Upon returning to Thanos, the cloaked figure revealed herself to be the Asgardian Death Goddess Hela who then brutally killed both Black Swan and Proxima Midnight to demonstrate her power. She told Thanos that she needed his help to reclaim her rulership of Hel and offered to grant him the death he has long been seeking in exchange. They then kiss in a passionate embrace.After Thanos was killed by Gamora, Hela along with the Black Order, now using Knowhere as their ship, stole Thanos' body from Starfox, in order for Hela to resurrect him. After getting the head from Annihilus, the Black Order went to Eros, who was revealed to be the consciousness of Thanos in the body of his brother, and plans to go back to his own body.


=== Corvus Glaive's version ===
After the restructuring of the multiverse, at the time when Thanos was missing, Corvus Glaive formed a second version of the Black Order where he gathered the worst criminals the universe had to offer as part of his plan to create his own empire. Using a moon called the Black Quadrant that belonged to Thanos, Corvus Glaive and the Black Order began to conquer different planets. When Thanos returned, he broke the blade off of Corvus Glaive's pike. Rather than die at the hands of Thanos, Corvus Glaive took the broken blade and killed himself. Afterwards, Thanos reclaimed the Black Quadrant.


=== Challenger's version ===
During the "No Surrender" arc, the Black Order was reorganized with Ebony Maw and Black Swan with Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, and Black Dwarf back from the dead while Supergiant is alive as a psychic projection. Earth was stolen from where it used to be the battleground for the Black Order's fight with an alien version of the Lethal Legion that was formed by Grandmaster. It was revealed that this Black Order was formed by the Challenger who is an old rival of Grandmaster. After the Avengers put an end to the contest, the Black Order regroups on the planet Angargal. They are approached by Grandmaster who had an offer for them.

=== Film ===
Ebony Maw, Black Dwarf (renamed Cull Obsidian), Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive appear in the 2018 film Avengers: Infinity War, in which they are known as the "Children of Thanos". Tom Vaughan-Lawlor voices and motion-captures Ebony Maw; Terry Notary voices and motion-captures Cull Obsidian; Carrie Coon voices and facial-captures Proxima Midnight, with motion capture being primarily provided by stuntwoman Monique Ganderton; and Michael James Shaw voices and motion-captures Corvus Glaive. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo took several creative liberties with the group's depiction, most notably excluding fifth member Supergiant for "consolidation". Other changes include renaming Black Dwarf, depicting the group as "Children of Thanos", and altering their abilities for the film. Assisting Thanos in finding the Infinity Stones, they are sent to Earth to retrieve the Time and Mind Stones, while Thanos, having already acquired the Power and Space Stones, goes to Knowhere to obtain the Reality Stone. Maw and Obsidian attempt to remove the Time Stone from Doctor Strange's Eye of Agamotto, though Maw kidnaps him when the attempt fails, while Glaive and Midnight attempt to steal the Mind Stone from Vision. Over the course of the film, they are each killed by the heroes they face: Maw by Tony Stark, Obsidian by Bruce Banner, Midnight by Scarlet Witch, and Glaive by Vision.
