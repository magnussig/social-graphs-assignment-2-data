The X-Cutioner (Carl Denti) is a fictional character, a former FBI agent obsessed with stalking mutants who kill humans. He uses an array of both alien technology (such as Shi'ar power armor and Z'nox sensors) and Earthly technology (such as Sentinel propulsion units) in his quest. Created by Scott Lobdell, he first appeared in Uncanny X-Men Annual #17 (1993).Denti's father was an army officer murdered for following an illegal order, which would later interfere with his crusade against mutants. Eventually becoming an F.B.I. officer, Denti partners with a contact of Charles Xavier's, Fred Duncan, a member of the mutant supporter network known as the Xavier Underground who maintains mutant criminal records and stockpiles the weapons and technology of X-Men foes. Denti takes the files, weapons, and technology for himself and assumes the name X-Cutioner, with the proclaimed mission of killing any mutant that has killed other people first. Denti is so "dedicated" to his mission that he will use lethal force to stop anyone obstructing his lethal "justice".
His first successful target is the mutant Tower, followed by an unsuccessful attempt on Mastermind, who was detained on Muir Island. Mastermind survives only to die of natural causes, because the X-Cutioner was delayed when he encountered the X-Men.  He next targets the White Queen, only to be stopped by the father-and-son duo of Cyclops and Cable. Later, he tracks down Skin for the murder of Angelo Espinosa, not knowing that the two boys were the same person. Working through the ranks of X-Men characters, he next encounters the Punisher, Rogue, X-Man, and Gambit. After teaming up with Gambit, Denti encounters a new X-Cutioner with similar technology.
A normal human with specialized training, X-Cutioner's weapons and technology include alien Z'nox sensors, Sentinel propulsion units for flight, Shi'ar body armor, a personal force field, a teleportation unit and various other weapons.
