Darter (Randy Vale) is a minor villain in Marvel Comics. The character, created by Bill Mantlo and Jim Mooney, first appeared in Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #29 (April 1979).
Randy Vale was an undergraduate at Empire State University. One day, Randy accidentally stumbled across a clone casket that once belonged to Miles Warren. The casket opened to reveal a decayed clone named Carrion. Upon learning of his creator's death, Carrion offered a partnership with Randy to get revenge on Spider-Man. In return, Randy was offered "power", but it was not specified with what exactly. Randy donned a high tech uniform and went by the name Darter. As Darter, Randy could glide through the air and fire lasers at his enemies. His first fight was with White Tiger who he actually managed to knock down. Later, the two would fight again in the gymnasium where Spider-Man and Carrion were fighting. When Carrion fled with Spider-Man, Randy realized that he was betrayed by his master and swore revenge on Carrion. He encountered his master while he was trying to drain the life from Spider-Man. Randy tried to attack Carrion, but he was hit with the red death causing him to rapidly deteriorate and die.
