Crule is a mutant whose first appearance was in X-Force vol. 1 #12. One of the immortal mutants known as Externals, Crule is the meanest and maddest of them all. According to Gideon, during World War II he worked in a concentration camp, happily operating a gas chamber. He is an ancient berserker, dressing like a barbarian and old enough to remember Mithras. Crule was sent by Gideon to attack X-Force after they rescued Sunspot. However, Crule is blasted out of X-Force's ship by Rictor and falls a few thousand feet, which puts him in a body cast.  Crule has enhanced senses, strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance. His body has natural weapons, including hair coiled into whip-like braids, fangs, and gauntlet-covered claws.
