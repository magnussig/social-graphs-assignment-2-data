Gilded Lily (Lillian von Loont) was featured in the series Alpha Flight. She was an alchemist of great talent and a student of Diablo. Lily was initially seen to be a woman in a golden mask, golden gloves, and a fur coat that covered her slender body to her feet. She had lived for an inordinate length of time, her makeup (on her mask) and hair were very much in the style of the 1920s, particularly that of Louise Brooks.
