Chaka was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, and first appeared in Iron Fist #8 in October 1976.
Within the context of the stories, Chaka (Robert Hao) learns martial arts from his older brother William. He eventually moves to New York and becomes the crime lord of the Chinatown-based criminal gang 'The Golden Tigers' while his brother William became a lawyer. In his battles, he uses electrified nunchakus.  He also has the power to control others' minds, which is amplified by a mystic crystal.
