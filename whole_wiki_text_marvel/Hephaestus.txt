Hephaestus first appeared in Thor #129 (June 1966), and was adapted from mythology by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. He is the weaponmaker of the Olympian pantheon. He is not to be confused with the Eternal Phastos. Immortal and possessing superhuman physical attributes similar to those of the other Olympians, Hephaestus is a master weapons maker and inventor, able to make weapons which could kill even Hercules, but lacks the ability to project any form of energy, mystical or non-mystical. He made Hercules's mace, Ares' armor, and Zeus' chariot.
