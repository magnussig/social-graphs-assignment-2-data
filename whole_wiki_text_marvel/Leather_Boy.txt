Leather Boy (Gene Lorrene) is a fictional villain in Marvel Comics. The character, created by Dan Slott and Paul Pelletier, first appeared in G.L.A. #1 (June 2005).
Gene Lorrene is a BDSM obsessed individual who answered an ad left in the paper by Mister Immortal to join his team the Great Lakes Avengers as Leather Boy. When they discovered that he did not have any superpowers (he misread the ad), he was immediately booted off the team. Much later, Leather Boy, now donning a Doctor Doom-inspired version of his outfit, learned of Squirrel Girl's indoctrination into the team and set out to take revenge. He broke into their base and snapped Mister Immortal's neck, though clearly he did not die, and killed Squirrel Girl's companion Monkey Joe. However, he was immediately stopped by Big Bertha who had just returned from a modeling session, and was defeated by being sat on by her. The rest of the team returned home and interrogated him where he revealed that Doctor Doom had battled the Fantastic Four in Greenwich Village hence why he was wearing a Doom inspired costume, it had been "all the rage" in his area. Leather Boy was dropped off at the police station shortly afterwards.Leather Boy got out, but Deadpool managed to catch him after the two somehow caused major destruction.Leather Boy once again tried to take revenge on Squirrel Girl by kidnapping Tippy-Toe at a Deadpool cosplay contest she was hosting. The real Deadpool, who had at that point gained total sympathy for her, caught Leather Boy and proceeded to allow the local squirrels to take revenge for their fallen comrade.
