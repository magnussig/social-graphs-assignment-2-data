Lady Lark (Linda Lewis), later named Skylark, is a character in the Marvel Comics series Squadron Supreme and hails from Earth-712. She first appeared in Avengers #85 (February 1971), and was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema. She is based on Black Canary and later on Hawkgirl in DC Comics.Linda Lewis was a singer before an enemy of the Squadron Supreme, Doctor Decibel, surgically implanted synthetic vocal cords into her throat, giving her the ability to generate a "sonic cry" which could incapacitate opponents. A reluctant hero at best, Linda often wished to return to her singing career.
She often partnered in crime-fighting, and later romantically, with the character Golden Archer (mirroring the relationship between the modern Black Canary and Green Arrow); however, she refused his marriage proposal. The Archer then used a mind-altering device to literally change her mind, but this had the unintended side effect of altering her personality to an air-headed, vapid persona that put her feelings for the Archer above all other priorities. This led to the two of them leaving the Squadron Supreme for a time.When the Archer died under his later identity of the Black Archer, Lady Lark seemed to slowly shake off the effects of the mental modification, and returned to active status with the Squadron. Feeling she needed to increase her abilities to stand beside teammates that she perceived as more powerful, she began using the artificial wings that once belonged to deceased teammate Blue Eagle to gain the power of flight, and renamed herself Skylark. With this new ability came greater confidence, and Skylark became far more aggressive in combat than she had been as Lady Lark.When returning to her native dimension with the team, she is injured and remanded to hospital care.An alternate version of Lady Lark appears in the Supreme Power: Hyperion mini-series.
