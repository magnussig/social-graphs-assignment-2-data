Tundra is a mystical spirit which inhabits an ever-growing mass of Canadian land in gargantuan semi-humanoid form, and is the enemy of the Inuit gods whom he trapped in another dimension. Tundra was the first of the Great Beasts confronted by Alpha Flight.  Tundra was summoned through a mystic ritual in which a possessed Richard Easton traced a gigantic human shape in the barren land of Canada's Northwest Territories and then donned a metallic crown that summoned the spirit of Tundra.  Easton's corpse animated, the land mimicking the corpse's movement until Tundra rose in the shape of a humanoid mass of earth.  According to Shaman, Tundra was supposed to be controlled by the mind of the human who summoned him but because of the weakened state of Richard Easton when summoning Tundra, Tundra's real personality quickly took over. Tundra's powers stem from the land itself.  He can summon mosquitoes, hurl boulders from his body, increase his size by absorbing land mass, and is connected to the land so if he is injured, earthquake-style upheavals occur in the surrounding area.
