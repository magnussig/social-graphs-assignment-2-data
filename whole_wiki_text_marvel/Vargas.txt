Vargas is a supervillain in the Marvel Universe. The character, created by Chris Claremont and Salvador Larroca, first appeared in X-Treme X-Men #1 in 2001. Within the context of the stories, Vargas comes into conflict with the X-Men while searching for the diaries of Destiny and even managed to kill Psylocke. He's not a mutant, since he lacks the X-Gene in his DNA, but is not fully human either, much like Captain America is a relatively perfect human physical specimen. He is genetically perfect and claims to be "homo superior superior", humanity's "natural response" to the emergence of mutants, and possesses super-strength and speed in addition to highly advanced combat skills. After obtaining one volume of Destiny's journals he discovered that he would be killed by Rogue, however Rogue realized that the diaries could trap you into doing what it stated, or into committing great atrocities to avoid the "prophecies". She was seen preparing to stab Vargas, but the video camera that was the sole witness to the event lost power at the critical moment, so the people that viewed the footage of the live invasion were under the belief that Rogue did in fact, kill him. Some time later it was eventually revealed that Rogue left Vargas alive after all in order to discredit the diaries, but because he had possessed one of Destiny's diaries and therefore had knowledge of future events, he was, under Mr. Sinister's orders, targeted by the Marauders and apparently eliminated after being stabbed by one of Harpoon's eponymous weapons.
