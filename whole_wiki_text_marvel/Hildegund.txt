Hildegund is a fictional character in Marvel Comics. She was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in Journey into Mystery #120 (September 1965).
Hildegund, sometimes called Gudrun, is the wife of Volstagg of the Warriors Three. She is an excellent cook and it is because of this that her husband is large and fat, something that makes Hildegund and Volstagg very happy. Together the happy couple had ten sons (Alaric, Arngrim, Einar, Gunnar, Hrolf, Leif, Rolfe, Svein, Sigfod, Thakrad), four daughters (Flosi, Gudrun, Gunnhild, Jargsa) and numerous unnamed children. At some point, twins, Mick and Kevin Mortensen were orphaned when their mother, Ruby, was killed by Zaniac. Thor took the twins to Asgard where Volstagg and Hildegund lovingly accepted them with open arms. When Loki returned, albeit as a child, everyone in Asgard turned him away except for Volstagg and Hildegund, the latter feeling that he just needed motherly love and affection.

Hildegund briefly appears in Thor: The Dark World played by Claire Brown. She has no dialogue and the credits simply list her as Volstagg's Wife. She is seen with Volstagg and three of their children celebrating one of their victories with Thor. Unlike her comic book counterpart, she is rather slim and not obese like her husband.
