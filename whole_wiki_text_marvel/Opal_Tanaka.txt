Opal Tanaka is known primarily as the former girlfriend of Bobby Drake (Iceman), a member of the mutant superhero team called the X-Men. Tanaka was first introduced in issue #51 of X-Factor in February 1990, created by Louise Simonson and Terry Shoemaker. Opal Tanaka lives in New York City and when X-Factor's ship takes up residence in the city, it blocks the sunlight that would strike her apartment, causing her plants to wilt. She encounters Iceman, who had come into the music store where she works, and expresses her views to him. Bobby, smitten with her, asks her out. Intrigued by Bobby, she accepts.
