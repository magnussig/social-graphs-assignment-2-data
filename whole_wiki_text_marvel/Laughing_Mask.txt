The Laughing Mask (Dennis Burton) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is a Timely Comics Golden Age superhero which appeared in Daring Mystery Comics #2, 1940, and reappeared in The Twelve.  He was a deputy district attorney who took to murdering criminals in the vein of Marvel's later The Punisher, although the Laughing Mask used a phosphorescent mask to scare his victims prior to the kill.
His one Golden Age story was reprinted in The Twelve #0.
For unknown reasons he became The Purple Mask (Daring Mystery Comics #3,4) and was the cover feature on Daring Mystery Comics #3. The first Purple Mask story was reprinted in Daring Mystery 70th Anniversary Special.
Michael J. Vasallo identifies The Falcon (appearing in Daring Mystery Comics #5-6) as a revamp of The Purple Mask.  That character was also a deputy district attorney, but his name was Carl Burgess and was, in terms of continuity, a distinct character.  The Falcon appeared on the cover of Daring Mystery Comics #5.  The Falcon did not kills his foes per se, but he allowed them to be killed by their own actions.
