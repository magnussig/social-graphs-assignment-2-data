Dyna-Mite (Roger Aubrey), subsequently known as Destroyer, was a member of the Crusaders. The character first appeared as Dyna-Mite in Invaders #14–15 (March–April 1977). He also appears as Dyna-Mite in The Invaders #18–23 (July–December 1977). Aubrey, a close friend of the hero Lord Falsworth, one of the Union Jacks, supported peace between Germany and Britain. Around 1938, the pair went on a German tour. War began and the two quickly discovered the evils of the Nazis. Both were thrown in prison. Falsworth's connections helped him but he could not help Aubrey, who was taken away. German scientists experimented upon Aubrey, while Falsworth became the 'Destroyer', fighting a guerrilla war against Germany. Aubrey is shrunk to just 12 inches (300 mm) in height, but manages to keep the strength of a full size man. He was brainwashed and sent to fight the Allies. He was eventually captured and reprogrammed. He joins the superhero team, the Crusaders, as Dyna-Mite.
