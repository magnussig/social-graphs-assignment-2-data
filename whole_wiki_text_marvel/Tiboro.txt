Tiboro is a humanoid being from the so-called "Sixth Dimension" who ruled a tribe of Earth humans in South America ages ago, but was eventually banished.  He now waits for Earth's civilization to fall into decadence and decay so that he can rule the whole planet. Most of Tiboro's power is contained in his wand, but he can also exercise formidable magical abilities without such artificial aids.  Tiboro has become a minor nemesis of Doctor Strange in modern times.  Tiboro uses an artifact called the Screaming Idol to communicate with creatures on Earth while he is in his own dimension.
