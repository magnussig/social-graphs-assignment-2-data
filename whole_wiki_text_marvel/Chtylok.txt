Chtylok the Che-K'n Kau first appeared in Sensational Spider-Man vol. 1 #13 (February 1997.) Chtylok is a 25-foot (7.6 m) tall half-chicken, half-cow creature that inhabits an area of the Antarctic, just outside the Savage Land. Millennia ago, the Fall People of the Savage Land worshiped the fearsome beast, until it went into hibernation. The hole in the ozone layer has begun to cause the ice around the Savage Land to melt, which wakes Chtylok from its hibernation. Somehow, it finds its way to the surface of Monster Island, and follows several fleeing monsters to the Florida Keys. There it meets the Hulk, and engages him in battle. Chtylok is a 25-foot (7.6 m) tall chicken-like monster with razor-sharp talons, bovine-like legs and hooves, and a large, spiked, prehensile tail. Despite his immense size, he is capable of flight. His strength is in the same class as the Hulk, as he was able to engage him in battle for some time.
