=== 1960s ===

The Red Barbarian was a Communist general in an unnamed country, known for his brutality. After an attempt to steal an atomic bomb prototype from Stark Industries is foiled by superhero Iron Man, the Red Barbarian is approached by another Soviet agent known as The Actor, who is superior in disguising himself. The duo scheme to steal the secret disintegrator ray blueprints of Tony Stark, who is actually Iron Man. The Actor is sent to impersonate Stark and get the plans. The Actor succeeds in doing so, through the means of changing from disguise to disguise, and even learns the secret identity of Iron Man. However, Iron Man manages to get back the classified papers from The Actor and he in return impersonates The Actor impersonating Iron Man and rushes to meet the Red Barbarian. The general is tricked and believes that Iron Man is The Actor in disguise. When he demands for the blueprints, Iron Man replies that the suitcase (in which the blueprints are supposedly in) is booby-trapped and it can only be opened four hours later, and then leaves. Just then, The Actor returns. The Red Barbarian thinks he is the imposter and shoots him, before he can tell the general Iron Man's secret identity.
