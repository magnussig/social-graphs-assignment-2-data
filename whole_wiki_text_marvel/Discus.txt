Discus (Tim Stuart) first appeared in Power Man #16 in December 1974, and was created by Tony Isabella and Billy Graham.  The youngest son of Tyler Stuart, a warden at Seagate prison, Tim Stuart was employed by Justin Hammer and given a costume, jet-pack, and assorted weaponry. He took the name Discus, as his weapon of choice was a throwing disc; he usually carried disc-shaped flying blades. He is the younger brother of Stiletto.
