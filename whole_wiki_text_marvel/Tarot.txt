Tarot (Marie-Ange Colbert) first appeared in The New Mutants #16 (June 1984) and was created by Chris Claremont and Sal Buscema.  Tarot is able to generate animated constructs composed of tangible psionic energy based on the two-dimensional figures on the tarot cards she carried. She can create multiple human-sized figures and even massive flying constructs without any apparent strain. Tarot's psionic constructs are superhumanly strong and durable, resistant to physical damage, temperature extremes, and certain forms of energy. They are completely under her mental control and will dissipate on her command.  Tarot is a member of the original Hellions.
