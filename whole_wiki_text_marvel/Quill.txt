=== Quill in other media ===
A character called "Kid Omega" (portrayed by Ken Leung) appears in X-Men: The Last Stand, but is modeled after Quill rather than Quentin Quire. The writer/director commentary on the home release clarified that the credits were mistaken and referred to the character as "Quill". Quill first appears as a member of The Omegas, then later joins Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with Callisto, Arclight, and Psylocke. During the attack on Alcatraz, Quill kills Dr. Kavita Rao and almost kills Dr. Worthington whose son, Warren Worthington III / Angel, comes to the rescue and protects. Quill, Psylocke and Arclight are later killed by Jean Grey's Phoenix Force powers.
In a bonus feature on the home release for X-Men: Apocalypse, Quill is featured in a voicemail message for Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.
