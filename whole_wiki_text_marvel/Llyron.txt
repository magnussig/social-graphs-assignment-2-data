Llyron is the son of Llyra, and was genetically accelerated in age by Llyra so that he might take the crown of Atlantis. His mother Llyra was a Lemurian/human hybrid and a foe of Namor. She decided to conceive a child with Namor and introduce him as a successor to the Atlantean throne. After discovering that Namor was sterile, Llyra instead seduced a human named Leon McKenzie to create Llyron. Leon's father Lawrence was Namor's half-brother via their father Leonard, thus making Leon Namor's nephew and by extension Llyron is Namor's great nephew. The Atlantean Council voted Namor off the throne, and declared Llyron to be his rightful heir. However, the sorceress Morgan le Fay raised Atlantis from the ocean floor, and in the resulting chaos Llyron left with a number of Atlantean refugees to find a new home.Llyron is named after his maternal grandfather Llyron who was Lemurian. His maternal grandmother was a human named Rhonda Morris.He has resurfaced in the Thunderbolts series, as the leader of Fathom Five, a militant Atlantean splinter group determined to destroy humanity. Llyron was defeated and nearly killed by The Radioactive Man. He escaped and returned to Atlantis, only to discover that he had radiation poisoning, and furthermore had spread the poisoning among the Atlantean population. Radioactive Man was able to reverse the poisoning.Llyron has super-human strength, agility, endurance, and some resistance to physical and energy attacks. He also possesses gills, allowing him to breathe underwater as well as on land, and can swim incredibly fast compared to humans. Llyron is resistant to cold, presumably another adaptation to undersea life.
