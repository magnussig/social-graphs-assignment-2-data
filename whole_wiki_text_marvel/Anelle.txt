Anelle is a Skrull princess, the heir to the Skrull Empire, and the daughter of Emperor Dorrek VII and Empress R'Kill. The character first appeared in Fantastic Four #37, and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. She often opposed her father Dorrek VII's policies, preferring peace to his aggressive military policies.
She falls in love with Warlord Morrat, but he is executed for treason by firing squad after a failed coup d'Ã©tat against Emperor Dorrek VII. She leaps in front of the weapon-fire in an attempt to save him, but the Invisible Woman surrounds her with a force field and saves her life.The Super-Skrull desires her, but she is not interested in the least. In an attempt to win her hand he captures the Kree Captain Marvel, the Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver, but her father interprets it as an attempt to usurp him and imprisons him instead. Anelle and the Kree man fall in love and have an illicit relationship, leading to the birth of future Young Avenger Hulkling. The emperor orders the baby put to death as soon as he realizes who the father is, but Anelle has her nurse smuggle the child off-world and he ends up on Earth with the nurse raising him. Galactus later consumes the Skrull Throneworld, and Anelle is among the billions who perish.
