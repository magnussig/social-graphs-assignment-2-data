Dominus is a sentient super-computer, created by the alien Quists and sometimes controlled by Lucifer. Dominus first appeared in X-Men #21 (June 1966) entitled "From whence comes... Dominus?", by Roy Thomas and Jay Gavin. Dominus was the channel by which the alien race known as "The Arcane" conquered planet after planet. At Lucifer's command post, the Supreme One tells Lucifer that the time is ready for his true purpose- to deploy Dominus. Dominus and Lucifer were then temporarily defeated by Charles Xavier, who suffered a debilitating injury in the process. The X-Men would go on defeat Lucifer permanently.
