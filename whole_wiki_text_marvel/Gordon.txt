=== Comics ===
Gordon made his comic book debut in Uncanny Inhumans #0 (June 2015) from Ryan Stegman and Ryan Lee. Gordon was imprisoned in another dimension with the monstrous Inhuman named Snarkle. Both were exiled by the Great King Kalden 2,000 years ago for unknown reasons. In modern-day New Attilan, two young Inhumans named Flint and Iso activate a portal to this other dimension. Snarkle enters their dimension with the intent of having their revenge, but Gordon chooses to stay declaring "Goodbye Snarkle. I never liked you", leaving Snarkle to be comically defeated by the younger Inhumans.
