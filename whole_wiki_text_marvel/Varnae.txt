Varnae is a vampire in the Marvel Universe. The character, created by Steve Perry and Steve Bissette, first appeared in Bizarre Adventures #33 (December 1982). Within the context of the stories, Varnae is the first vampire and is the one who created Dracula. At various times in his life, he is an enemy of King Kull, Frank Drake, and John Blaze. He eventually tired of his eternal life and committed suicide by walking into sunlight and disintegrating into dust, but he was resurrected years later by the voodoo priestess Marie Laveau. He was then confronted by Doctor Strange. The Sorcerer Supreme and the Lord of the Vampires battled, Varnae changing shape and revealing he had formerly sought to be Sorcerer Supreme before he became a vampire. Strange cast an "incantation of oblivion" on Varnae, making the undead mage relive his oblivion of 500 years. Embracing his existence as a vampire again, Varnae fled, claiming that, with Strange, he finally had a reason to live again: a worthy foe.
