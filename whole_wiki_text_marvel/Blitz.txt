A heavily adapted character appears in Marvel's Spider-Man named Barkley Blitz, voiced by Ogie Banks. The male leader of a group of adrenaline junkies called the Wake Riders, he initially uses the Vulture mantle and later the Goblin moniker while being a fanboy of Adrian Toomes. In the episode "Rise Above It All", Blitz manipulated Spider-Man to be involved in some stunts while covering up the Wake Riders' heists. During a heist on Horizon High, Barkley and the Wake Riders were joined by the Vulture as a leader but are defeated by Spider-Man and Ultimate Spider-Man. However, Barkley and the Wake Riders are released from police custody when their publicist Gabby Flenkman has a cover story that J. Jonah Jameson supports. During the "Goblin War" arc, Blitz is part of the Goblin Nation as the Goblin King's personal enforcers, engaging in combat with Spider-Man and Harry Osborn before being defeated by Ghost-Spider.
