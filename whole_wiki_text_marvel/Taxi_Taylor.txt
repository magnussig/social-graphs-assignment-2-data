Jim "Taxi" Taylor is a Marvel Comics adventurer who made his debut in Mystic Comics #2 (April 1940).  He drove a submersible flying machine called the Wonder Car and stabbed enemy agents from "Swastikaland" as part of a day's work as a taxi driver.  Taylor was created by an unknown creative team for Harry "A" Chesler Studios.  The Taxi Taylor feature did not appear again, but he appeared in the Golden Age revival series, All-Winners Squad: Band of Heroes and with Howard the Duck and Spider-Man.
