Whether or not it was indeed Loki-in-disguise has not been answered.


=== Andrew Forson ===
Andrew Forson is the sixth character within A.I.M. to use the title of Scientist Supreme. The character first appeared in Fantastic Four #610 and was created by Jonathan Hickman and Ryan Stegman.
Forson was the Scientist Supreme of A.I.M. after the organization became public and established their base in the now-sovereign island nation of Barbuda and overthrew the Wizard with consent of the rest of A.I.M.. Barbuda was then renamed A.I.M. Island.Forson appears as the Supreme Leader of the new High Council of A.I.M., consisting of Graviton (as the Minister of Science), Jude the Entropic Man (as the Minister of Health), Mentallo (as the Minister of Home Affairs), Superia (as the Minister of Education in Bagalia), the female Super-Adaptoid (as the Minister of State in Bagalia), and the undercover Taskmaster (as the Minister of Defense). Forson then leads A.I.M. into attending a weapons expo, which led to A.I.M. fighting against the Secret Avengers. During the battle, Forson takes the opportunity to steal the Iron Patriot armor. Daisy Johnson launched an unsanctioned operation to send the Secret Avengers to A.I.M. Island to assassinate Forson, and the group seemingly killed him. Despite Johnson ending up suspended for breaking protocol and Maria Hill being put in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. again, Forson was revealed to be alive all along, and the news of A.I.M. being a new permanent member of the Security Council is known.Forson finds Superia badly injured after an incident on A.I.M. Island regarding an escaped creature. An A.I.M. Agent then approaches Forson and Superia, showing the two a 2-D hologram of the organism beating the Avengers. Taking pride in this, Forson orders their translocator activated and to retrieve their "lost child". When Taskmaster is shot and seemingly killed by Mockingbird now under Forson's control, Forson revealed that Mockingbird was secretly working for Forson years ago, and that he used Mockingbird to "get Victorious out of the way" so that he could take over the Cult of Entropy. Forson also uses Adaptoids from an alternate reality to combat the Avengers. Using an unidentified device, Forson and A.I.M. accelerate the flow of time in the limits of A.I.M. Island, creating in a matter of hours for the real world year of progress and transforming A.I.M. into a technologically advanced empire. When Smasher comes to the island, Forson has Jude the Entropic Man transform her into his messenger.Forson is an experienced scientist with genius-level intellect.

=== Television ===
The Lyle Getz iteration of A.I.M.'s Scientist Supreme appears in Iron Man: Armored Adventures. In "Ready, A.I.M., Fire", he assists his fellow A.I.M. operatives in building MODOK. In “Designed Only For Chaos”, A.I.M. uses the Living Laser to finish creating MODOK, who murders the Scientist Supreme so he can can take control of A.I.M. even though Getz was planning on doing so anyway.
Two different versions of A.I.M.'s Scientist Supreme appear on The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, voiced by Nolan North (first iteration), and by Kyle Hebert (Lyle Getz). In "Breakout Pt. 1", an unidentified Scientist Supreme negotiates with Doctor Doom's agent Lucia von Bardas, before Iron Man intervenes and captures the A.I.M. agents. They are transferred to the Vault, though they later escape off-screen. In "Alone Against A.I.M", the Scientist Supreme attempts to get revenge via the Technovore, but he is defeated by the Avengers. In "Prisoner of War", Getz is captured and replaced by a Skrull infiltrator before he joins forces with Captain America and his fellow prisoners to escape. In "Secret Invasion", Skrull Queen Veranke orders the Skrull impersonating Getz to use satellite weapons to destroy all life on Earth in response to the Avengers foiling her invasion, but Thor destroys the satellites while the Skrulls are arrested by S.W.O.R.D. agents.
An amalgamated iteration of A.I.M.'s Scientist Supreme appears in the Avengers: Ultron Revolution episode "Adapting to Change", voiced by Jim Meskimen. This version has George Clinton's appearance, Valdemar Tykkio's accent, and Andrew Forson's attire. This Scientist Supreme uses three Adaptoids to fight the Avengers before merging with them to become the Supreme Adaptoid, only to be defeated by the heroes and absorbed by Ultron.
