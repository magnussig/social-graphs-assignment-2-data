Their first appearance is in the show's seventh episode, appropriately named "Stick". Stick plays an integral part in the episode, while Stone's appearance is far more minor, having occurred within the last few minutes, and, during which, his face is not seen. Stick reappears in Season 2, which explores his ties with Elektra Natchios and Chaste's war against the ninja clan known as the Hand, led by Nobu. In flashbacks, it is revealed that Elektra is the Black Sky, a living weapon worshipped and coveted by the Hand. After disagreeing with Star (portrayed by Laurence Mason) over Elektra's future, Stick kills him and flees with her.The Chaste return in The Defenders. The Chaste are revealed to be an army loyal to the Iron Fist, and serve K'un-Lun in their war against the Hand. Danny and Colleen are introduced trying to get information from a Chaste soldier named Shaft (portrayed by Marko Zaror) in Cambodia, but Elektra attacks them and kills him before he can give them anything. On their return to New York, the two follow a trail that leads them to an empty warehouse littered with dead bodies, later revealed by Stick to have been the last members of the Chaste.
