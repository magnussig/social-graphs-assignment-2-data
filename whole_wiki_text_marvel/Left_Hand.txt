Left Hand (Diego Casseas) is a fictional supervillain from Marvel Comics. The character, created by Fabian Nicieza and Mark Bagley, first appeared in New Warriors #16 (October 1991).
He is a member of the Folding Circle. Diego Casseas' wife was one of the brides of the Dragon's Breadth cult that Diego's military unit, the "Half-Fulls", encountered in Cambodia during the Vietnam war. The cult had been breeding superhumans for centuries, hoping to tap into the vast power of the Well of All Things, a mystic portal in an ancient temple. The Half-Fulls became part of this breeding program, each member fathering a child with a cult member. Diego's wife died and their daughter was left comatose after the fall of an elevator. Diego, having studied sorcery, stole his daughter's powers ten years later and became the Left Hand. The Left Hand had the ability to access and manipulate the energy of the Darkforce dimension. He used this ability to project blasts of extreme concussive force (sufficient to kill a human being with little effort), and to teleport himself and others over long distances.
