Glob Herman (Robert Herman) is a fictional mutant character, a supervillain and later superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. His first appearance was in New X-Men #117. Glob was created by Grant Morrison and Ethan Van Sciver.The young mutant called Glob Herman has skin that is completely transparent and made up of bio-paraffin, or "living wax". Though he lives among other mutants, Glob Herman easily stands out. Herman is friends with Kid Omega, one of Professor Xâ€™s top students.Glob Herman enrolled into the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning after Professor X was publicly revealed to be a mutant. Herman joins the unsanctioned, teenage Omega Gang, led by Kid Omega, as they secretly take a hard line stance for mutant rights. With the Omega Gang, Herman attacks the humans who they thought had murdered Jumbo Carnation. He later participates in the slaughter of a group of U-Men. When the Omega Gang instigate a riot at the Xavier Institute, Herman has Redneck light him on fire. He then pursues a bus full of human civilians, chasing it at full speed down the highway. Cyclops, Xorn and Beast pursue. Beast saves the lives of two men in a sports car who cross Herman's way, which he turns into scrap metal without slowing down. When the chase nears a gas station with a cement mixer, the X-Men manage to surround Herman. They use the mixer to cover him with cement and the Beast uses water bottles from the station himself to put out Herman's fire. At that point, much of Herman's covering of bio-paraffin has burned away, and he is reduced to a skeleton with only a relative thin layer of wax. Later, Herman is seen, still covered in cement, being ferried back to the X-Mansion on a specialized truck. For his crimes, the X-Men send him to help the needy in Africa.
