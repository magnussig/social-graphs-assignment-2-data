=== Film ===

Chris Sullivan appears as Taserface in the film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. He is the lieutenant of Yondu's faction of the Ravagers. After officially being assigned to direct Guardians of the Galaxy and considering Taserface to be "the dumbest character of all time," Gunn jokingly posted a photo of him on his social media. He later clarified that he would never feature the character in a film. Gunn later changed his mind, and when crafting this character, felt that Taserface had named himself. Hence he described him as "a real dumbass," yet also "a very powerful guy." Taserface is depicted as being proud of his name as he believes it strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. However Rocket, and the rest of the Ravagers, scoff at the ridiculousness of his name. Feeling that Yondu is "going soft", he leads a mutiny against him which involves tossing those who are still loyal to him out the airlock. After Kraglin aids Yondu, Rocket, and Groot in escaping from their prison cells, Yondu kills off all of his former Ravager comrades that sided with Taserface and blows up the main engine severely burning Taserface. The heroes eject from the main ship, leaving Taserface to die. Before the ship explodes, Taserface contacts the female Sovereign representative to give the coordinates of Yondu's escape ship. In return, Taserface wishes to be known as the one who caused Yondu's defeat. Taserface then dies in the ship's explosion while the Sovereign representative laughs at his name.
Discussing the character's look in The Art of the Film, Visual Development Illustrator Anthony Francisco says, "Taserface was described to me as needing to be very scary-looking, but he wants you to think he is the absolute coolest. I translated this into conceptualizing various things he might wear or add onto his Ravager jumpsuit â€” things that he thinks are badass or interesting. But ultimately, he is just trying too hard."
