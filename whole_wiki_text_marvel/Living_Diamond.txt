The Living Diamond first appeared in X-Men #39 (December 1967), and was created by Roy Thomas and Werner Roth.  The Living Diamond was a criminal whose latent mutations were activated by exposure to atomic radiation, which gave him flexible living diamond-like hands and telepathic and teleportational powers. After further exposure to radiation, his entire body took on the same diamond-like properties which increased his strength yet slowed him down.
