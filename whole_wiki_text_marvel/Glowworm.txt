Glowworm is the name of two unrelated fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Though created only a few months apart, they have little in common except the name.

William BlakeFirst appeared in Power Man and Iron Fist #123 (May, 1986). This Glowworm was William Blake, a former soldier who had volunteered for experiments to re-create the Super-Soldier Serum. After leaving the Marine Corps, one night he transformed into a huge, glowing white creature who began screaming racial slurs and attacking black people in Power Man's neighborhood. When news got out that a "white mutant" was attacking blacks, it nearly sparked a race riot, but once Cage defeated the creature, it reverted to human form, revealing that he was a black man himself. Blake had grown up in the Deep South, at a time when rampant racism led him to believe that blacks were inferior to whites, resulting in his own hatred of himself and his own race.It has been revealed that Glowworm has remained in custody since his initial capture.

GlowwormThe second Glowworm first appeared in X-Factor #7 (August, 1986). This Glowworm is a mutant with a humanoid torso, and a worm-like tail instead of legs. He is the partner of Bulk, a mutant with enormous size and strength.
Bulk and Glowworm were outcasts, not just for their mutant status or unusual appearance, but because both continually gave off toxic levels of hard radiation. The two sought shelter in a toxic waste dump in New Jersey, but upon hearing about the group X-Factor (who at that time were posing as mutant hunters), the pair decided to attack them to "protect mutants". After a short battle, the members of X-Factor explained their true nature as mutants themselves. The two returned to their isolation.In New Mutants Annual #4, Bulk and Glowworm seemingly sacrificed their lives to save Danielle Moonstar.
