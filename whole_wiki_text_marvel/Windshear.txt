Windshear (Colin Ashworth Hume) is a mutant superhero and member of Alpha Flight. Created by Fabian Nicieza and Michael Bair, the character first appeared in Alpha Flight #87 (April 1991). He has the ability to project "hard-air" molecules, which he can use to create constructs, release as concussive force, and propel himself in flight. He was born in Canada, but grew up in Britain.
Hume was hired by Roxxon Oil Corp and given a battlesuit that allowed him to control his powers more thoroughly. When he was unable to defeat a machine-creature at Roxxon's Denver Energy Research station, the company called in Box and Diamond Lil. The trio and Forge discovered James MacDonald Hudson at the machine's core. Hume, upset about Roxxon's practices, quit the company and returned to Canada with the members of Alpha Flight, and was soon accepted onto the team, first on a probationary basis and later as a full member. He was later appointed the Chief Administrator of Alpha Flight. He was one of the superheroes who vanished during the Infinity Gauntlet saga when Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet's power to sacrifice half of the population of the universe to Death. He appears in Infinity Crusade as one of the Goddess' mind-controlled lackeys.Eventually, the Canadian government disbands Department H and the Flight programs, and Hume returns to England. Hume set up a curio shop to sell "hard air" constructs. When the Thunderbolts were investigating a series of murders committed with bullets created out of hard air, they investigated Hume and learned of Roxxon's connection.He is among those depowered by M-Day, but continues to fight crime in Toronto under the alias Chinook.
