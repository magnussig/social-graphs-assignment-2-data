Kwaku Anansi first appeared as an unnamed god in Thor #398 by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz and made his named appearance in Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 2 #48 by J. Michael Straczynski and John Romita Jr..
Anansi was a member of the Vodu, deities worshipped by the tribes of Africa. According to Ezekiel Sims and the Ashanti tribe in Ghana, Anansi was the very first Spider-Man who used his powers to travel through Africa. Anansi made a deal with the Sky God, Nyame, offering his eternal service in exchange for more enlightenment and after transmitting his power and knowledge to the Great Web, he vanished. His temple was then used by Peter Parker to defeat the totemic wasp entity, Shathra and was then used as a battle arena, when Peter and Ezekiel started fighting in order to appease totemic entity, the Gatekeeper.During "Spider-Island", Anansi was disguised as a pest specialist known as A. Nancy and visited Hercules at the place where Hercules was working. After talking for a bit, Hercules helped Nancy to sneak into Arachne's apartment in order to steal her Tapestry. After that, Nancy was attacked by Elektra who stole the tapestry, but left Nancy alive, even though Baba Yaga had ordered her to kill him.
