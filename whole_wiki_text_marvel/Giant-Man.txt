Scott Lang / Ant-Man (portrayed by Paul Rudd) serves as the Marvel Cinematic Universe equivalent of Giant-Man; various interviews with directors Anthony and Joe Russo, Marvel Studios's head Kevin Feige, and Ant-Man director Peyton Reed confirmed this. In Captain America: Civil War (2016), Ant-Man grows in size during a battle against Iron Man's faction of Avengers, allowing Captain America and Bucky Barnes to escape. In Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), Scott Lang goes giant when going after Sonny Burch's gang, becoming extremely fatigued if he is giant for too long. In Avengers: Endgame (2019), he uses the form to break free of the ruin of the New Avengers facility and subsequently joins the Battle of Earth as Giant-Man.
