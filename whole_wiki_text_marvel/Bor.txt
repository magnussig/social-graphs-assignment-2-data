Nevertheless, Bor strongly sided with Odin and the two went into battle against the Frost Giants. Bor went up against one giant, who was actually a time traveling Loki in disguise, and battled him, but was killed.Loki would impersonate Bor's ghost to get Odin to defeat Laufey and adopt the boy that would become Loki. Loki resurrected Bor in modern day, but affected his mind making him think that monsters were everywhere. He encountered his grandson Thor and the two fought in a destructive battle that involved the Dark Avengers. Bor was killed by Thor who only found out about his identity afterwards by Loki and Balder. Hela later brings Bor back to life to lift Mjolnir. When he was unable to, Hela reduces him to dust. She then uses him to battle Thor once again.Bor once again returns to halt the wedding between Asgardian Sigurd and Valkyrie DÃ­sir, causing much ire with the two as well as Danielle Moonstar, Hela, and Loki.
