Quagmire (Jerome Meyers), a villain from the Squadron Supreme universe and member of the Institute of Evil, first appeared in flashback in Squadron Supreme #4 and fully in Squadron Supreme #5, and was created by Mark Gruenwald.
The character is a mutant with the ability to manipulate the extra-dimensional Darkforce in the form of a thick, dark, viscous tar-like substance. He can open a dimensional interface anywhere within thirty feet of him, and can control the flow of Darkforce from a thin spray of globules to a thick torrent of oozing slime. His darkforce manifestation is extremely adhesive: a sufficient quantity can immobilize beings of significant superhuman strength. He can also apply small quantities of it to his fingertips and toes in order to scale walls and ceilings. He can shape the Darkforce into animated tendrils or whip them about his person in a psychokinetic tornado.
He and the rest of the Institute of Evil hold the Squadron Supreme's loved ones hostage but are defeated, put through a behavior modification process, and granted full membership in the Squadron.Quagmire later goes into a coma saving civilians from an industrial accident. While comatose, he interfaces with the Darkforce dimension, drowning Doctor Decibel and flooding the hospital with Darkforce until Hyperion disconnects his life support. Quagmire is sucked into the dimension and presumed dead.Quagmire eventually enters the mainstream Earth dimension through the Man-Thing's body. This apparently restores his criminal personality, and he battles Quasar and Jennifer Kale.
