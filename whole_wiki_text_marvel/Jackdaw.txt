Jackdaw is a fictional character featured in the Marvel Comics universe. He was created by Dez Skinn, Steve Parkhouse, Paul Neary and John Stokes, and first appeared in The Incredible Hulk Weekly #57 (April 1980).
A now-deceased hero, the sidekick of Captain Britain, Jackdaw was an Otherworld elf. Jackdaw had been mortally wounded earlier in his adventures, but was revived by Merlyn and given new powers and a new costume.
He was permanently slain later on Earth-238 by The Fury. Jackdaw was literally torn in half by one of the Fury's energy bolts and expired shortly thereafter in Captain Britain's arms. Jackdaw expressed a belief that Merlyn would resurrect him. Saturnyne had abandoned them (and her assistant Dimples, who loved her deeply) to escape. Merlyn did not resurrect Jackdaw as it would have damaged his chances of rescuing Captain Britain, who was killed as well by the Fury after Dimples and Jackdaw, and resurrected by Merlyn back on Earth-616.
