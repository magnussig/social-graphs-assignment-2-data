Centennial (Rutherford B. Princeton III) is a fictional superhero in Marvel Comics, notably Alpha Flight. He was created by Scott Lobdell, and first appeared in Alpha Flight vol. 3 #1 (2004).
Rutherford spent some time as a police officer in Canada. During the Prohibition, he was sent to assist law enforcement officers in America. At one point, his girlfriend Amelia Weatherly goes missing and is later assumed dead. Rutherform 'buries' her and moves on with his life.
He later slips into a coma lasting nearly two decades. The Alpha Flight member named Sasquatch recruits a new team of heroes, including Rutherford, who is roused from his coma. Rutherford helps rescue the original Alpha Flight and fight the Japanese team Big Hero Six. Later, they fight the criminal 'Manimator'.
During his last known adventure, he travels back in time. His teammate Nemesis reveals that she is Amelia. Their post-Alpha Flight adventures have not been shown. A vision indicates the two were buried side by side, per the epilogue of Alpha Flight vol. 3 #12.
