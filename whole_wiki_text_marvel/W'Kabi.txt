W'Kabi appears in the Black Panther TV series, voiced by Phil Morris.
W'Kabi appears in the film Black Panther, portrayed by Daniel Kaluuya. He is depicted as T'Challa's best friend, Okoye's lover, and the chief of the Border Tribe. Ulysses Klaue had killed his parents decades earlier while stealing vibranium. As he is responsible for the borders of Wakanda, W'Kabi and his guards have trained armored white rhinoceroses as shock cavalry. W'Kabi loses faith in T'Challa when he fails to capture Klaue, and supports Erik Killmonger when he subsequently usurps the throne. During the final battle, Okoye confronts W'Kabi when he tries to trample M'Baku with an armored white rhinoceros, saying she values Wakanda more than their love. Not wanting to die by Okoye's hands or take her life, W'Kabi surrenders and the rest of the Border Tribe does the same.
