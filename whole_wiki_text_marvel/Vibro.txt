Vibro, also known as Alton Vibereaux, was created by Denny O'Neil and Luke McDonnell and first appeared in Iron Man #186 (Sept. 1984). Working as a seismologist and engineer, he fell into the San Andreas Fault during the testing of an experimental nuclear-powered apparatus, giving him superpowers and leaving him mentally unstable. He battles James Rhodes as Iron Man. He is later sent to the Vault, a prison for superpowered individuals. Alongside the Griffin, he attempts to escape, encountering the Falcon and Nomad.Vibro is killed and resurrected by the Hand, and joins an assault on the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier. Mandarin and Zeke Stane later recruit him to help defeat Iron Man.Vibro has the ability to generate high-level seismic vibrations and fire them from his hands as vibratory or concussive force, causing shockwaves, opening chasms, and/or generating earthquakes. He can harness the energy of his vibratory force emissions for flight at subsonic speeds, and he has the ability to generate shields of vibratory force around himself. His powers decrease in magnitude as his distance from the San Andreas Fault increases. He also wears body armor of an unknown composition and synthetic stretch fabric. As Vibreaux, he has a Ph.D. in geological engineering.
