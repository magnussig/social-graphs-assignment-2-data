K'ythri is fictional deity created by Warren Ellis and Carlos Pacheco and first appeared as a depiction along with his wife Sharra in Starjammers #1.
According to the Shi'ar mythology, the two chief deities, K'ythri and Sharra, were the creators of the universe. At first, they were enemies to each other, but were then forced into marriage, in which they found love. At their day of marriage, K'ythri presented her the M'Kraan Crystal as their sign of love.They were worshipped by the Shi'ar for millennia, until they were killed by Amatsu-Mikaboshi, but it seems that they had come back to life.They were then convinced by Loki that they needed to force the new Thor to take part on their Challenge of Gods in order to prove their superiority. Even though they outscored Thor, thanks to their disposition to cause mass suffering in order complete certain tasks, the challenge's officiate Shadrak declared Thor as the winner, since she inspired the Asgardians gods to help her in defense.
Infuriated, they called upon "their sister" the Phoenix Force to destroy all reality, but with the help of Quentin Quire, Thor and the Asgardians appeased the Phoenix Force. Sharra and K'ythri were then imprisoned in Omnipotence City, since they had broken the divine law.
