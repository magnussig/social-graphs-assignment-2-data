Ramrod is a foreman on an offshore oil rig.  He was turned into a cyborg by corrupt attorney Kerwin J. Broderick and Moondragon, using the advanced technology of Titan.  He was given a steel skeleton and superhuman strength. This steel-skulled mercenary was sent to battle heroes in San Francisco. He then teamed with Dark Messiah and Terrex in Kerwin J. Broderick's attempt to take over San Francisco. Ramrod later battled Spider-Man again. He was later among the costumed criminals who attacked the Fantastic Four during a Congressional hearing. Ramrod was also defeated in a match by Captain America, impersonating Crossbones, during an A.I.M. weapons show. Ramrod has superhuman strength, stamina, and durability. He possesses a steel skeleton; various visible portions of his body are also plated with steel, including his head (except for his face and ears), the upper part of his chest and back, parts of his arms, and his knuckles. Ramrod is a good hand-to-hand combatant, using street fighting methods.
