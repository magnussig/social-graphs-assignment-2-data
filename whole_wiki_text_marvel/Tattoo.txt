Tattoo, also known as Longstrike, is a mutant, a student of the Xavier Institute. Created by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, the character first appeared in New X-Men #126. She can display messages or designs on her skin, as well as phase through solid matter.
She is one of the many students who were mentally controlled by Cassandra Nova to attack Wolverine and Beast. Tattoo and the other students are freed from Cassandra's influence by the Stepford Cuckoos. She is romantically involved with another student named Slick, but later breaks up with him when she discovers his true appearance.Tattoo joins the Omega Gang, led by Quentin Quire, which includes her brother Radian. They set out to avenge what seems to be the murder of Jumbo Carnation, a popular mutant clothes designer. They also attack and kill a group of murderous, mutant-hunting U-Men. The Omega Gang starts a riot at Xavier Institute during 'Opening Day' celebrations, an event designed to bring the public to Xavier's. Several members, including Tattoo, confront the X-Men on the front lawn. During the battle Tattoo manages to phase her hand into Cyclops's head. She informs him if she became solid, he would die. Emma Frost turns into her diamond form and places her hand inside of Tattoo's head; now Tattoo would also die if she became solid. This eliminates the stand-off. After the Omega Gang is neutralized, all but Quire are sentenced to jail.Tattoo is one of many mutants that lose their superhuman powers after M-Day.After being released from jail, she joins the New Warriors under the codename Longstrike, using a version of Stilt-Man's armor since she no longer has her abilities. However, she is killed on one of the team's first missions.
