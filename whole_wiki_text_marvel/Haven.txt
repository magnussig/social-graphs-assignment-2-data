Haven (Radha Dastoor) is a fictional mutant character, created by J.M. DeMatteis and Greg Luzniak, who first appeared in X-Factor #96. She was the best-selling author of a book about the new humanity that would result from humans and mutants evolving into one race. She planned to bring this 'new humanity' about by destroying three quarters of the world in a Mahapralaya, or 'Great Destruction', as foretold in her Hindu teachings.X-Factor opposes her, but she is able to sway Wolfsbane by curing her of the genetic engineering that had turned her into a mindless Genoshan mutate, allowing her to once again assume human form. X-Factor shuts down her entire operation with the help of her brother Monsoon. She attempts to cure Jamie Madrox (not the original, although no one knows that) from the Legacy Virus, but she fails and he dies, leaving X-Factor to believe the original Madrox is dead.Haven herself has no powers, but is carrying a mutant fetus, with various abilities ranging from healing to telepathy to opening dimensional portals into personal pocket dimensions. The fetus acts through Haven, leaving the true nature of the situation unknown to the general populus. The fetus was the product of an old affair that never came to term, instead remaining a sentient embryo. Haven's efforts to cause destruction attract the attention of the Adversary, who uses her fetus to return himself to the world, consuming Haven in the process.
