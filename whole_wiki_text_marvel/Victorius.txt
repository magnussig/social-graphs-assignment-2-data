Victorius is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Victor Conrad was a scientist working for A.I.M. who succeeded in duplicating the Super-Soldier Serum which had transformed Steve Rogers into Captain America. Conrad drank the serum himself and became a physically perfect human being. Naming himself Victorius, he first attempted to take over A.I.M. Failing to do so, he later adopted the death-worshiping philosophy of the Cult of Entropy and made himself their new leader. He stole the Cosmic Cube to use to create Jude the Entropic Man as a means of spreading destruction. Jude rebelled against Victorius, and when Jude, Victorius, the Cube and the Man-Thing all came into physical contact with each other, Jude and Victorius were transformed into a form of radiant crystal. Years later, Andrew Forson reveals that Mockingbird had been secretly working for him at the time and that Mockingbird was used to "get Victorius out of the way" in order to take over the Cult of Entropy.
