Infinity (comic book)

"Infinity" is a 2013 comic book crossover storyline that was published by Marvel Comics. Written by Jonathan Hickman with artwork by a rotating team of artists including Jim Cheung, Jerome Opeña, and Dustin Weaver, the series debuted in August 2013 and ran through November 2013.
The storyline concerns issues built up in multiple Marvel comic books as part of the Marvel NOW! initiative, primarily Avengers and New Avengers. These issues include a threat to the universe by an ancient race of aliens known as the Builders. The second is the mysterious ailments plaguing the universe with Earth at the center. The third is the political ramifications these events have on Earth's relationship to the rest of the galactic community.
The story itself involves Thanos attacking Earth while the Avengers are in space uniting the universe against the Builders, with the events of the 2013 "Age of Ultron" storyline acting as a catalyst for the rest of the universe to formally target Earth. The various tie-ins tell Thanos's attack from the perspective of various Marvel characters.
The aftermath of the event leads directly into the "Inhumanity" storyline, in which the Terrigen Mist is released throughout Earth, activating the latent abilities of dormant Inhumans.A new Infinity-based event titled Infinity Countdown began February 2018 as part of the Marvel Legacy initiative.

== Plot summary ==


=== Prologue – The Tribute ===
On a distant planet, an alien being known as Outrider returns (Outriders are genetically produced assassins that serve their masters) and brings a message about a planet known as Ahl-Agullo to another alien being, Corvus Glaive. Corvus Glaive relays this message for his master and asks if this pleases him. Corvus Glaive's master replies "yes" as the Outrider is sent on another mission. Corvus Glaive appears on Ahl-Agullo and demands a tribute from the king of the Ahl-Agullo and references that its planet's greatest warrior and son is dead. Corvus Glaive then reveals that the last time his master came to this world, he burned this world down and asks the king to pay a tribute. Returning to his master, Corvus Glaive gives his master Ahl-Agullo's tribute and asks if this tribute pleases him. Corvus' master Thanos replies "yes". The tribute is revealed to be a crate containing the severed heads of many Ahl-Agullo citizens.


=== Prelude ===
A week before the current events, Nightmask finds Starbrand drawing pictures with his powers while imprisoned on Sol's Hammer. Starbrand remarks that so much has changed for him and that he would see the hydrogen in the Sun fusing together and he asks what is happening to him. Nightmask states that as his powers evolve, so does his mind. Nightmask then resumes coaching Starbrand. A little while later, Starbrand learns that the prison is not powerful enough to hold both him and Nightmask and asks why don't they leave, but Nightmask says they must wait until he has full control of his powers.
Meanwhile, Manifold and Captain Universe have arrived on the alien planet Galador. Captain Universe tells her teammate to return to Earth and tell the Avengers that they have not done enough, that the Machine is not complete as Captain Universe quotes "To protect a world your must possess the power to destroy a world." Manifold leaves as the Galadorian Spaceknights leap into action.
Back on Earth, Bruce Banner warns the Avengers of the approach of the mysterious Organism that has escaped from A.I.M. Island and is headed to their location. Worse yet, Banner then transforms into the Hulk and seriously damages the Helicarrier. The Avengers are then slammed by the Organism, and fight back but are beaten.
On A.I.M. Island, Andrew Forson (the current Scientist Supreme) and Superia are licking their wounds from the Organism's escape. An A.I.M. Agent then approaches them showing them a 2-D hologram of the Organism beating the Avengers. Taking pride in this, Andrew Forson orders their translocator activated and to retrieve their "lost child".Upon receiving word from Captain Universe of a threat that is coming to Earth, the Avengers are advised to get Ex Nihilo and Abyss on their side and to free Starbrand and Nightmask so that they can help combat this threat. The threat in question turns out to be the Builders who are destroying many "imperfect" planets that don't fit their vision, and have cataloged Earth as a failure ever since they learned of Ex Nihilo's creation. The Avengers follow Captain Universe's suggestion and get Ex Nihilo, Abyss, Starbrand, and Nightmask onto the team.Corvus Glaive and the rest of the Black Order (which also consisted of Black Dwarf, Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight, and Supergiant) arrive on Earth and appeared at the different parts of the Earth to confront the Illuminati. Corvus Glaive and Supergiant arrived at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, Black Dwarf arrived in Wakanda, Ebony Maw arrived at the Sanctum Sanctorum, and Proxima arrived at Atlantis.


=== Core miniseries and Avengers/New Avengers ===


==== Part 1 – "Infinity" ====
Arriving on Earth, the Outrider begins looking for Earth's secrets as he searches through Avengers Tower and the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Appearing at a S.W.O.R.D. base, the Outrider is seen killing a S.W.O.R.D. agent in an effort to find Earth's weakness. While badly beaten by the Inhumans, the Outrider is ultimately able to inform Thanos that the Avengers have left Earth, prompting his forces to prepare to invade Earth.


===== Avengers – "Avengers Universe 1" =====
The Avengers travel in space to the Galactic Council to decide the fate of the incoming Builders. The decision is to lure them into a trap and destroy them. Things go well in the Council's favor until the Builders decloak the rest of their fleet and destroy most of the Council's frigates. The Avengers, together with the remaining ships retreat in defeat.


===== New Avengers – "The Cull Obsidian" =====
Thanos' Black Order arrives on Earth and demands a tribute in exchange for the survival of its inhabitants. Black Bolt reveals to the Illuminati that Thanos used the demand for the tribute (the heads of young Inhumans between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two) as a cover for the search of his lost Inhuman-descendant son.


==== Part 2 – "Fall" ====
Most of the alien empires try to stop the Builders, which causes some catastrophic results. The Black Order arrives on Attilan where they demand a tribute of young Inhuman heads that range from the ages of 16 and 22. Using the Terrigen Codex, Black Bolt discovers that Thanos was using the demand for a tribute as a cover-up to kill his lost Inhuman-descendant son whose actual identity and location are unknown to him.


===== Avengers – "Building Towards Collapse" =====


===== New Avengers – "The Thanos Seed" =====
Black Dwarf retreats after finding a heavy resistance in Wakanda, causing his expulsion from the Black Order. Using the Terrigen Codex, the Illuminati embark on the search for Thanos' son Thane, but are stopped by the appearance of a new incursion in Australia. Before reaching a decision about what to do about the other Earth, the Illuminati are greeted by an Aleph arriving from the other Earth. The Aleph leads them to the Builders of that universe who explained that the early death of the Multiverse had led to the collapse of the superflow (the space between universes that they used to traverse them). In order to avert disaster and ensure the Multiverse survives, the Builders across the multiverse have decided to destroy all Earths, thus hopefully stopping the incursions. Since the Builders of Earth-616 had failed in their mission, these Builders urged the Illuminati to destroy their own world.


==== Part 3 – "Kingdoms Fall" ====
Most of the alien empires have decided to surrender to the Builders. Captain America managed to make himself heard by the Galactic Council and planned a retaliation against the Builders which resulted in the successful liberation of the Avengers who were being held captive and the destruction of numerous forces of the Builders, partially turning the tide of the battle. After the Inhumans deny a tribute to Corvus Glaive, Thanos appears on Attilan to meet with Black Bolt. Black Bolt attacks Thanos with his hypersonic voice.


===== Avengers – "The Offer" =====
Black Dwarf is given another chance to prove himself by Thanos. Black Dwarf is sent to keep the Peak from being reclaimed by the Avengers.


==== Part 4 – "Thane" ====
Captain America still realized they were outnumbered and outgunned, and decided to perform a false surrender. Thor falsely surrendered to the Builder who was under control of Hala and killed him, freeing the planet and gaining powerful lost allies. Thanos eventually survives Black Bolt's attack and continues the fight. As Thanos fights against Black Bolt, he detonates a Terrigen Bomb which decimates Attilan and subjects everyone on Earth bearing latent Inhuman genes to go through the process of Terrigenesis, resulting in the emergence of thousands of Inhumans. Thane's power is unleashed, where it kills the inhabitants of his town in the process. Thanos fights Black Bolt where he demands to be told the location of his son. Black Bolt refuses to reveal the location which results in Thanos getting angry and knocking out Black Bolt.


==== Part 5 - "The Left Hand of Death" ====
The death of the Builder at Thor's hands and the subsequent liberation of Hala sparks a general insurrection at all Builder-occupied worlds, which are dubbed "Avengers Worlds" by their grateful citizens in honor of Earth's heroes.

The Avengers and their allies head to Earth to free it from Thanos.


===== Avengers - "...To the Very End" =====
Black Dwarf fights the Avengers to keep them from reclaiming the Peak. During the battle, Ronan the Accuser arrives to help the Avengers where Ronan declares Black Dwarf guilty and kills him.


==== Part 6 - "Amber" ====
The Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Agent Brand and her personnel retake the Peak while Starbrand devastates the majority of the enemy fleet with his power, forcing the survivors into a retreat. In Necropolis the Illuminati confront Supergiant and an enslaved Gladiator, and she is defeated after Lockjaw teleports her to an uninhabited world along with an anti-matter bomb that Maximus detonates. Captain America, Captain Marvel, the Hulk, Hyperion, and Thor confront Thanos and his Black Order in Orollan. Corvus Glaive is killed by Hyperion, but Thanos and Proxima Midnight put the Avengers on the brink of the defeat. Ebony Maw turns on his master and manipulates Thane into putting Thanos and Proxima Midnight into a state of "living death", freezing them in amber. In the aftermath, the heroes and their allies pick up the pieces and rebuild in their own way, while the Illuminati continue to secretly find ways to prevent the impending death of the multiverse, with Thanos and Proxima Midnight in their custody.

It was revealed the Junkman of Brooklyn was a man called Gavrel Achter, who was one of the newly surfaced Inhumans after Black Bolt unleashed the Terrigen Mists upon the entire face of the Earth. When Nick Fury Jr. tried to talk to the Junkman of Brooklyn, he threw a car at the team, seemingly crushing Sarah Garza. Sarah raised from the debris and retaliated the Junkman of Brooklyn.

In their review for #1, IGN state "Infinity [#1] isn't your typical Marvel event comic, and that's definitely a good thing" and, throughout their reviews of each issue, praise the use of the wider Marvel Universe, the pacing, and how it "reads like a natural extension of Hickman's Avengers work", the depiction of Inhumans, the strong sense of scope and drama and the cohesive art, though criticising how it doesn't function well as an isolated story and "reads better with tie-ins".
Comic Book Resources stated that Infinity is "one of Marvel's strongest event series in years", and gave Infinity #1 a rating of 9.0 calling "a summer comic in all its glory.

CBR called Infinity #2 "a must-read.", giving it 9.0, and in their review of Infinity #3, gave it 9.0 and called it "rife with intrigue, twists and poignant moments" and that "Hickman creates a dark, foreboding atmosphere appropriate to a war that seems impossible to win in his narration and dialogue".

CBR also called Infinity #5 a "great comic for those looking for pure, unfiltered, cosmic space adventure, and nothing but.
