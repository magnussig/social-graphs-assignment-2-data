== Publication history ==
The character was adapted from mythology by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby.
Hercules debuted in Avengers #10 (Nov. 1964) as a minion of Immortus, although his appearance was revealed in the limited series Avengers Forever #1 - 12 (Dec. 1998 – Nov. 1999) as being an impostor. The character's first formal appearance in the Marvel Universe became Journey into Mystery Annual #1 (1965), which established Hercules as being a rival of the thunder god Thor.Hercules became a regular guest star in the title Thor, appearing in issue #126 (March 1966). The character guest-starred in Tales To Astonish #79 (May 1966), and his deadlocked battle with the Hulk, as told by Lee, Kirby, and Bill Everett, has come to be regarded as a classic. The tale parallels Hercules and the Hulk's titanic strength, short temper, and simple-mindedness, while contrasting their lot in life: Hercules being a beloved hero and pampered celebrity, while the Hulk is a hated and feared fugitive. The character teamed up with the Avengers in issue #38 (March 1967), but was not yet an official member; he was merely a guest of the Avengers during his banishment from Olympus. In issue #45 of The Avengers, Hercules became a "full-fledged Avenger" by way of Goliath's announcement to the press during the first annual "Avengers Day".  Hercules also guest starred in Marvel Team-Up #28 (Dec. 1974) and Marvel Premiere #26 (Nov. 1975) before starring along with four other heroes in The Champions which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975 – Jan. 1978). After this, Hercules made a guest appearance in Marvel Two-In-One #44 (Oct. 1978).
Hercules starred in two limited series by writer-artist Bob Layton, with both set in an alternate universe. A 24th century version of Hercules starred in Hercules, Prince of Power #1 - 4 (Sep. – Dec. 1982), which was popular enough to spawn a sequel, Hercules, Prince of Power vol. 2, #1 - 4 (March – June 1984). The storylines dealt with Hercules's exile from Olympus, completion of a series of quests and opportunity to leave his past behind and create a new identity.
Hercules remained a constant guest star in both Thor and the Avengers, playing a significant role in the "Avengers Under Siege" storyline in Avengers #270 - 277 (Aug. 1986 – March 1987), involving supervillain team the Masters of Evil. The story lead directly into the "Assault on Olympus" storyline in Avengers #281 - 285 (July 1987 – Nov. 1987), in which Hercules left the team.
The character starred in the self-titled limited series Hercules vol. 3, #1 - 5 (June - Sep. 2005), and guest starred in the limited series Thor: Blood Oath #1 - 6 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006), a retrospective story that depicts the second meeting between the Hercules and Thor.
At the conclusion of the "World War Hulk" storyline, Hercules received a self-titled publication when Marvel changed the name of the third volume of the Incredible Hulk series to The Incredible Hercules, effective as of issue #113 (Feb. 2008), and written by Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente. The series concluded with Incredible Hercules #141 (April 2010), and was followed by the 2-issue mini-series Hercules: Fall of an Avenger (March - April 2010). The mini-series is scheduled to lead into the relaunched new title, Prince of Power #1 (May 2010), also written by Pak and Van Lente.Writers Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente started a brand new Hercules series, entitled Herc, featuring the hero without powers, but wielding mythical arms.

== Powers and abilities ==
Hercules possesses the typical powers of an Olympian god, including superhuman strength, durability, speed, reflexes, stamina and endurance. He is the strongest of the Olympians, being capable of feats such as lifting and hurling a giant sequoia tree, smashing rocks to powder, sealing an entire cliff around an opponent with his bare hands, knocking out a yellow-crested Titan, and dragging the island of Manhattan (though this was later retconned to be merely a boast he had made, and not a genuine feat). His superstrong legs allow him to run at speeds of over 100 mph, and leap over a hundred feet into the air. He can withstand blows from Thor, and possesses a complete resistance to high caliber bullets.Hercules is highly skilled in archery, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, and claims to have invented the martial art Pankration. In combat he occasionally wields a golden-looking adamantine mace - stated and shown to be equal in durability to Thor's own mystical hammer Mjolnir (though it is not enchanted with additional abilities as Mjolnir is) - forged by the Greek god Hephaestus. As an Olympian, he is resistant to all earthly diseases, possesses a healing factor, immortality, and also has some immunity to magic. However, his strength can be taken by significant Olympian magic, such as that of Zeus.Hercules sacrificed his godly powers to save humanity in the wake of the Chaos War, and was completely powerless. Despite this, he retained his exceptional physical condition compared to a normal human, incredible skills in archery and hand-to-hand combat and access to magical weapons and items that help in battle. At the start of the 2015 Hercules series, his powers made an unexplained return. They were later revealed to have been restored through scientific means. At this time, Hercules made use of both antique and modern weapons, such as assault rifles, tasers, grenade launchers, and others.

An alternate universe version of Hercules stars in a humorous limited series titled Hercules, which depicts the adventures of Hercules in the 24th century. Banished from Olympus by Zeus in order to learn humility, Hercules travels into deep space where he meets the Rigellians who loan him Recorder #417. After adventures on several planets, Hercules arrives in the Omacron star system where he confronts the cosmic entity Galactus and, after being completely humbled, manages to save the world Galactus intended to devour.This was followed by a second series with a darker tone. Set forty-one years after the first series, Hercules and Recorder #417 meet and eventually befriend an alien Skrull called Skyppi (initially using his shapeshifting abilities to pose as a gorgeous human female). The demigod and his allies then face a cosmic version of the hero Red Wolf and a villain - devoted to the Titan Thanos - who breaks into the tomb of Kree hero Captain Marvel and steals the character's Nega-Bands. Hercules eventually returns to Olympus, and after a battle with Zeus (who has apparently gone insane and killed the other Olympian gods) proves he has learned humility by sparing Zeus's life. Zeus reveals the other gods are not dead, but now exist on another place of existence where Zeus himself will also reside. Hercules is advised that he is now free of his past, and that the character can found his own dynasty.Hercules and Skyppi next appeared in a 5-page back-up story in an issue of the reprint series Marvel Tales.Hercules, Skyppi and the Recorder next all appeared in the graphic novel Hercules, Prince of Power: Full Circle. The trio are captured by Emperor Arimathes, who turns out to be a son Hercules never knew existed, the product of one of his romantic adventures in the first limited series. Having been manipulated all his life by his bitter and vengeful mother, Arimathes is a cruel tyrant and Hercules must do what he can to prevent a war and save his son from his destructive path. A three-part storyline in the anthology series Marvel Comics Presents served as an epilogue to the events of the graphic novel.The final adventure of this version of Hercules was presented in a third limited series, Hercules: Twilight of a God. Set 75 years after the events of the first limited series, this story introduces the three grandchildren of Hercules, a new alien Silver Surfer, and the Galactus Black Hole that threatens all life in the galaxy. The fates of Skyppi, Recorder #417 and Arimathes are revealed as Hercules sacrifices himself to stop the expansion of the galactic threat and, in doing so, alters the destiny of both himself and Galactus.
