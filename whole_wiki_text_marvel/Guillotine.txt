Guillotine or Jeannine Sauvage is a fictional mystic character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Guillotine has no superpowers but is an expert swordswoman and wields the mystic Fleur du Mal, a sword with dark supernatural powers (the sword name means literally "The Flower of Evil" in French). Born of a mixed French-Algerian heritage, she is the latest in her bloodline to inherit the sword. The character was conceived by writer Al Ewing and the full design was developed by Kabam art director Gabriel Frizzera and artist Paco Medina.  She first appeared in the second volume of Contest of Champions released October 7, 2015 (cover dated December 2015).  Shortly after, she made her debut in the game Marvel: Contest of Champions. In 2017, Guillotine was briefly featured in the title U.S.Avengers. 
In 1793, an ancestor of Sauvage, Jean Desmarais, found the mythical Fleur du Mal sword in the Paris catacombs when escaping the authorities for being a revolutionary. Since then, it was passed on to his descendants with the most recent one being Jeannine Sauvage. Jeannine discovered the sword at age twelve by being lured to a room that was usually locked by a voice. While inspecting the sword, she slit her finger with its edge, and the blood dripped into the sword. This caused Jeannine to become cursed to wield this sword like her ancestors before her. During the Secret Empire storyline, Guillotine appears as a member of the Champions of Europe alongside Ares, Captain Britain, Excalibur, Outlaw, and Peregrine. With help from Squirrel Girl and Enigma, the team manages to liberate Paris, France from Hydra occupation.
