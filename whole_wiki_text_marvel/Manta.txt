She first fought the X-Men in the Shi'ar Empire's attempt to police the Phoenix Force.Later during New X-Men, she fought them under the manipulation of Cassandra Nova. In the latter, Manta seeks out Jean Grey, confident she could defeat Phoenix while armed with psychic armor, but Grey easily bested her in hand-to-hand combat. Manta was one of the survivors of the battle with Vulcan.Manta possesses the power of flight. Manta's eyes only perceive heat (as in infrared radiation), allowing her to see in the dark. She can generate blinding flashes of white or blue light. Her species experiences memory in a manner different from that of most other species.
