Wild Thing (Rina Logan) is a mutant character in the alternate future MC2, daughter of Elektra and Wolverine. Created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Lim, the character first appeared in J2 #5 (Feb 1999). She had her own series for a time, but due to low sales it was cancelled after issue #5.
For a short period of time, Wild Thing was a member of a superhero team composed of herself, Magneta, and Daze, but quit when Magneta became villainous. When Loki kidnapped several of Earth's heroes (including her father), Wild Thing's enhanced senses were pivotal in finding them.Rina possesses many of her father's mutant abilities, including accelerated healing and superhuman senses, strength, reflexes and endurance. She also has a set of "Psi-Claws", created from psychokinetic energy, which, although they appear similar to her father's adamantium claws, usually inflict damage on a mental rather than a physical level. However, it has been shown that if she concentrates hard enough, her claws can actually slice through steel and stone. Her fighting skills are impressive, as her parents have trained her in martial arts. Her skills are sufficient to enable her to engage J2 in hand-to-hand combat and hold her own, despite the advantages his much greater strength provides him.
