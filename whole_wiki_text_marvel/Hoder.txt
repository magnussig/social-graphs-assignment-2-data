Hoder first appeared in Thor #274-275 (Augustâ€“September 1978), and was adapted from mythology by Roy Thomas and John Buscema. He is a totally blind, elder Asgardian god. At one point, Loki, God of Mischief, tricks Hoder into nearly killing Balder by shooting him with an arrow made of mistletoe wood (the only substance to which Balder is vulnerable). As well as possessing the superhuman abilities shared by all the Gods of Asgard, such as superhuman strength, Hoder can also receive visions of a far distant future or of events that will occur in other realities.
His dealings with Balder are detailed in the 'Trials of Loki' four part story.
