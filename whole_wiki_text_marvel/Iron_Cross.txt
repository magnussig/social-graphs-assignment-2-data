Iron Cross was later kidnapped by Kurt Dagmar due to her new nature alongside the other robots and A.I.s. Iron Cross managed to send a signal for help which was received by Winter Soldier. The control Dagmar had over Iron Cross was interrupted when he was killed by one of his Deathloks. She thanks Namor for absolving her father of any war crimes during the Nuremberg Trials.She later battles Neo-Nazis in Germany and requests help from the All-New Invaders. They are interrupted by the Inhuman Lash, who is attempting to recruit Iron Cross, Toro, and the Neo-Nazis leader, who had no idea he was an Nuhuman. Medusa and the Inhuman Royal Court appear, so Lash leaves with the Neo-Nazi, who abandons the Nazi cause since he doesn't have pure Aryan blood. The Invaders later disband and Iron Cross returns to Germany to protect it from evil.

Helmut Gruler wears an advanced suit of armor that provides superhuman strength and durability, and flight via boot jets.
