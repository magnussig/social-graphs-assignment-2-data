Veil, also known as Madeline Berry, was created by Christos Gage and Mike McKone. She first appeared in Avengers Academy #1 (Aug 2010). She has the ability to change into a gaseous form, which enables her to sneak around without being detected and renders her immune to most forms of attack.
Berry learns that her powers are causing her molecules to drift apart, so that she will eventually die or fade from existence, and decides to enjoy the limited time she has left, quitting the academy and joining Jeremy Briggs' corporation. She soon finds a cure, but it renders her powerless. She then returns to regular high school, using her training to defend herself from bullies.
