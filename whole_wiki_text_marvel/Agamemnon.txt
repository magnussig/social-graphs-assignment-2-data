Agamemnon is a half-human, half-Asgardian. He was born immortal, and though he never physically aged beyond the age of 16 (although he employs holograms to appear as an old man), the Pantheon members are all his descendants: Achilles, Ajax, Andromeda, Atalanta, Cassiopea, Delphi, Hector, Jason, Paris, Perseus, Prometheus, and two characters named Ulysses. He recruited the Pantheon, stationed in the Nevada desert based headquarters called The Mount. Hela once called him Vali Halfling. He first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #381 (May 1991).Aside from being immortal, he does not appear to have superhuman powers. He is a master in analyzing and forecasting the future development of social structures, as well as a master battle strategist and an excellent hand-to-hand combatant. He also has access to the highly advanced technology produced by the Pantheon scientists and craftsmen. Since the revelation that he is Loki's son, he has also demonstrated knowledge of magic and spell casting. Though he does not appear to have any innate magic ability, he has shown skill in employing magical artifacts and rituals.
