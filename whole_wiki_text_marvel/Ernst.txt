Ernst, a fictional mutant created by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, first appeared in New X-Men vol. 1 #135 (April 2003).
Ernst, whose physical appearance suggests that she may be a teenage girl suffering from progeria or dyskeratosis congenita, is a student at the Xavier Institute. She briefly joined the so-called Brotherhood assembled by the mutant Xorn when he went on a drug-induced, destructive rampage as Magneto in New York City. Ernst did not show any signs of aggression herself. She is one of the few mutants who have retained their powers after the events of "M-Day". She continues living at the Xavier Institute.
In the alternate dystopian future of Here Comes Tomorrow, Ernst is revealed to actually be a rehabilitated Cassandra Nova, or at least a fragment of her, but this has yet to be revealed in the present era.
During the Quest for Magik arc, she was transported to Limbo alongside the other students and was captured by Belasco. She returned to the school with the rest of her classmates when Magik/Darkchilde sent them all back to the human world.Later, Ernst appears with the inhabitants of Utopia, the new base of X-Men.
As part of the Jean Grey school's remedial class, she goes on weekly crime-fighting patrols with Special Counselor Spider-Man.
