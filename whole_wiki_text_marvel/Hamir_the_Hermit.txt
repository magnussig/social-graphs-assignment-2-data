Hamir was the descendant of Kan, who started the tradition of assisting sorcerers who used their magic for good. Hamir brought his son Wong to meet the Ancient One, becoming one of his disciples in the process. Hamir was constantly outdone by evil sorcerers such as Baron Mordo and Kaecilius whenever they came for the Ancient One, nonetheless he continued to serve his master in sickness and in health. When the Ancient One passed away, Hamir stayed at the temple and continued to train newer students.
