Geist (Nikolaus Geist) was a supervillain in Marvel Comics. He was created by Archie Goodwin, and first appeared in Wolverine #17 (November 1989).
Geist had been an adviser for Adolf Hitler during World War II, and gave Hitler ideas on how to run the concentration camps. To escape war crime punishment, he used German rocket scientists to help the OSS. He later participated in questionable CIA operations. During Wolverine #17 and later issues, however, he was an adviser to President Caridad, of the fictional South American country Tierra Verde. Caridad wanted Geist to create a superhero and champion for Tierra Verde, much like Captain America. He was experimenting on humans with a special crop of cocaine, which drove the victims mad. His main guinea pig was Roughouse. Wolverine learned of this, and even though Roughouse had been his enemy, he helped him escape.
Wolverine cut off Geist's metal shell, leaving him to die. However, Tierra Verde allowed CIA agents to bring Geist out of the country allowing subsequent repairs. Soon after that, Magneto caught up with him and brought him into an abandoned house, exacting his revenge for the death of Magnus' wife and supposedly killing him off-panel.
Geist was a cyborg, but had no superpowers.  Due to his advanced age he was encased in a metal shell simply to survive.
