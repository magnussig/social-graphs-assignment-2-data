Silver Scorpion (Elizabeth Barstow) first appeared in Daring Mystery Comics #7 (April 1941), during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books, and was created by Harry Sahle. He signed her origin story with the pen name Jewell, which comics historian Michael J. Vassallo believes marks a collaboration with another, unknown artist. She is Marvel Comics' first superheroine, following the antihero character Black Widow, who reaped evildoers' souls for Satan.Betty Barstow, a secretary for private detective Dan Harley, wore a superhero-style costume to a masquerade ball, and along the way used her jiu-jitsu skills and investigative acumen to solve a case her employer had turned down. Enjoying it, she continued to be a masked crimefighter.Silver Scorpion is an honorary member of the Invaders. She appeared with the Golden Age Human Torch as a supporting character. She later joined the Liberty Legion.In the Avengers/Invaders storyline, Spider-Woman (who was actually the Skrull queen Veranke) disguised herself as Silver Scorpion when the Avengers found themselves stuck in the WWII era.
